# Healthcare-Disparities-US
Exploring the differences and gaps in the quality of healthcare within the United States

## Introduction
The United States healthcare system is characterized by a blend of cutting-edge medical innovations and ongoing challenges surrounding access, affordability, and disparities in care. While advancements in treatments and technology are notable, a significant amount of the population still struggles with barriers to comprehensive healthcare coverage and rising costs. Our primary goal is to comprehensively analyze healthcare disparities at the state level in the U.S. We aim to utilize diverse datasets to identify and understand the factors contributing to these disparities, ultimately seeking pathways to address them effectively.

This research could help get some insights into health disparities, identify areas for improvement in healthcare access, and guide the development of targeted initiatives to address inequities and improve outcomes.

The datasets were downloaded from public servers such as Kaggle, countyhealthrankings.org, and ahrq.gov, and they consist of a variety of information regarding population-specific differences in disease prevalence, health outcomes, access to healthcare services, and many more attributes, all at the state and county level.
